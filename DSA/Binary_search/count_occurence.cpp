/*
Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7, X = 2
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 4
Explanation: x = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7, X = 4
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: X = 4 is not present in the given array so the output is 0.

Logic: find first and last occurence index; its length is the answer
